% A wrapper function to Screen('Flip')
% used to draw a small rectangle (either black or white) just prior to the flip
% to obtain the most accurate time stamp from a photodiode attached to the

% This is to adjust for LCD lag time (which can range between 10-20 ms...)
% Differs from fnFlipWrapper - allows for manual input of which color to display (fnFlipWrapper is a toggle)
